The tab Measurements contains the raw measurements. Additionally, the sum of times per participants are contained.
The tab Outlier_Ordered_Type_Param contains the measurements plus the outlier computation.

./Analysis_TypeSystems_Constructor_Flat.omv

Contains the jamovi-Analysis of the results.

Within the file, there are two filters on "Possibly_not_followed_Exp_Procedure" and "is_outlier".  By selecting/unselecting the filters, one receives the corresponding ANOVA results.

./Analysis_Background_Significant_t.omv
The significance test for the background on whether or not t is sifnificant.

./ChiSquared_Test_Preference.omv
The ChiSquared test on the preferences on whether t is significant.

./ChiSquared_Test_Status.omv
The ChiSquared test on whether status shows effect on t.

./Outliers_ChiSquaredTest.omv
Checks effect of Background (and type system) on errors.

./Pretest.omv
The pre-test for the experiment (checks, whether treatments of t are different in the two sections).
