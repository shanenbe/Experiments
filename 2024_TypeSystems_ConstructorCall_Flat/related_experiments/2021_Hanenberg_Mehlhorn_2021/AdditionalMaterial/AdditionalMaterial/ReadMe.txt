The additional material consists of the following files

1. AIC_LE_NOf1.jar (the experiment)
2. CodeStats_Task1.xlsx (the statistics for the the code snippets for task 1)
3. CodeStats_Task2.xlsx (the statistics for the the code snippets for task 2)
4. Task1_Data.sav (SPSS file with raw data for task 1)
5. Task2_Data.sav (SPSS file with raw data for task 2)
6. CodeSnippets.zip

1. Experiment execution / AIC_LE_NOf1.jar
=========================================
The experiment environment is contained in the Java program AIC_LE_NOf1.jar.

In order to run the program, you need to install:
- Java 15
- JavaFX 11

One executed, the program generated a csv file in the folder where you started it. The first column of the csv file is the task id, the second the time (in miliseconds) and the third column contains data, whether the input was correct (0=false, 1=true).

2. Experiment measurements (Task1_Data.sav / Task2_Data.sav)
============================================================
The files contain the raw data measured on 2 subjects. The files are created and analyzed SPSS v26.

3. Code statistics (CodeStats_Task1.xlsx / CodeStats_Task2.xlsx)
================================================================
The excel tables described the statistics of each code snippet. 

4. Code Snippets from Experiment
================================
The zip-file CodeSnippets.zip contains all code snippets used in the experiment. Each filename corresponds to the ID of the code snippets in the experiment.
